# Flight-Operating-System
The project basically was to make flight operating systems with the provided routes towards our destinations via either connecting flights or via direct flights. When we try to visualize the given problem it exactly fits the concept of graph implementation because of the kind of info it needs to use and because of the way it operates because it provides us with different nodes pointing either one way to two way making them directed vertices and helps us understand the implementation of the graph and related algorithms depending on the scenario we are working on.
